# safe-gap
 An illustration of motorway traffic. 
 
 traffic2.htm uses javascript and images to simulate traffic flow on a motorway.
 Originally written by Brian Jones in 2009 it's offered here for anyone to use it or develop it.
 
 The idea of safe-gap was prompted by the need to understand what is actually a safe-gap at different speeds, different road surface conditions and different traffic densities (VPM, vehicles per minute). The generally accepted safe gap is 2 seconds, which is about equivalent to 30 VPM. When traffic is very dense it often exceeds 30 VPM and forces drivers to leave less than 2 seconds from cars  in front and behind.
 
 Fun to play with. Set the lead car to 80mph. Let the traffic settle down for a few minutes so they're all doing 80mph then slow the lead car to 45mph, simulating an unforeseen event like traffic ahead being forced into the same lane by slower traffic on inside lanes. See what happens when you alter the traffic density and road surface.
